Chapter 4 Fertilizer Use by Crop
Fertilizer consumption in India has increased signifi-cantly in the last three decades. Total NPK (N, P2O5 and K2O) consumption increased nine-fold (from 2 million to 18 million tonnes) between 1969/1970 and 1999/2000. Per-hectare NPK consumption increased from 11 to 95 kg in the same period. After reaching a record level in 1999/2000, fertilizer consumption in India has been irregular. It has fluctuated around 17 million tonnes since 2000/01 (Table 11).

FERTILIZER USE BY AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONE
Fertilizer consumption varies widely between the AEZ owing to the substantial differences in soil type, fertility status, crop, weather, rainfall, irrigation facilities, etc. (Table 12). AEZ 4 was the most important region in terms of fertilizer use and consumed 3.5 million tonnes of fertilizer (21 percent of the total) in 2003/04 on 30 million ha of cropped area. In six AEZs (Nos. 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 13), the annual fertilizer consumption has exceeded one million tonnes and together they accounted for about 63 percent of total fertilizer consumption.

Per-hectare consumption was highest in AEZ 7 followed by AEZ 9 and AEZ 18. The rate of fertilizer consumption was more than 100 kg/ha in six of the AEZs (Nos. 4, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 18), which cover 38.4 percent of gross cropped area (GCA). In ten of the regions (AEZs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 19), covering 49.5 percent of the area, per-hectare fertilizer consumption ranged between 50 and 100 kg, whereas in the remaining four regions (AEZs 10, 11, 17 and 20) covering 12.1 percent of the area, the rate of fertilizer consumption was less than 50 kg/ha.

All 20 AEZs of India have been grouped into six broad ecosystems on the basis of bio-climatic factors.

Arid Ecosystem
The arid ecosystem, comprising three eco-regions (AEZs 1 – 3), consumed 1.46 million tonnes of fertilizer (N+P2O5+K2O) in 2003/04 and accounted for 8.7 percent of total fertilizer consumption. This ecosystem covers 25.1 million ha, representing 13.4 percent of the total GCA of the country. Per-hectare fertilizer consumption was 58.2 kg, varying from 54.6 kg in AEZ 2 to 76.2 kg in AEZ 3. In terms of nutrients, N, P2O5 and K2O consumption was 40.1, 15.0 and 3.1 kg/ha, respectively. There was a wide variation in nutrient consumption among the AEZs of the arid ecosystem. N consumption varied from 39.5 to 55.4 kg/ha, P2O5 consumption from 10.2 to 20.6 kg/ha, and K2O consumption from 1.1 to 12.7 kg/ha. Fertilizer use and crop productivity are very low in all the regions of the arid ecosystem owing to factors such as rainfed monocropping, the short length of the growing period, and erratic and scanty rainfall.

Semi-arid Ecosystem
The semi-arid ecosystem is the most important ecosystem in terms of area and fertilizer use. Comprising five ecoregions (AEZs 4 – 8), it consumed 7.4 million tonnes of fertilizer (N+P2O5+K2O) in 2003/04 and accounted for 47.3 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. The ecosystem covers 79.25 million ha, representing 42.4 percent of total GCA of the country. Per-hectare fertilizer consumption was 100.2 kg, varying from 65.5 kg in AEZ 6 to 177.1 kg in AEZ 7. In terms of nutrients, N, P2O5 and K2O consumption was 65.6, 25.9 and 8.7 kg/ha, respectively. There was a wide variation in nutrient consumption between the AEZs of the semi-arid ecosystem. N consumption varied from 38.9 to 109.0 kg/ha, P2O5 consumption from 18.6 to 46.8 kg/ha, and K2O consumption from 3.3 to 29.7 kg/ha. Although mean annual rainfall is 500 – 1 000 mm in AEZ 4, fertilizer use and crop productivity are moderately high as 65 percent of the region is under irrigated agriculture. In the northern plains, farmers have overcome the drought-prone climate by introducing tubewell irrigation. Fertilizer use and crop yields are low in AEZs 5 and 6 because rainfed farming is the traditional practice. Fertilizer use is highest in AEZ 7 because good rainfall and better irrigation facilities enable farmers to grow higher fertilizer consuming crops in this region.

Subhumid Ecosystem
The subhumid ecosystem, comprising six regions (AEZs 9 – 14), consumed 5.04 million tonnes of fertilizer (N+P2O5+K2O) in 2003/04 and accounted for 30 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. The ecosystem covers 58.9 million ha, representing 31.5 percent of the total GCA of the country. Per-hectare fertilizer consumption was 85.5 kg, varying from 44.6 kg in AEZ 10 to 166.9 kg in AEZ 9. In terms of nutrients, N, P2O5 and K2O consumption was 60.7, 19.0 and 5.8 kg/ha, respectively. There was a wide variation in nutrient consumption between the AEZs of the subhumid ecosystem. N consumption varied from 25.5 to 127.6 kg/ha, P2O5 consumption from 13.8 to 30.9 kg/ha, and K2O consumption from 2.1 to 10.1 kg/ha. Fertilizer use and crop productivity are high in AEZ 9 because soils are deep, loamy and have developed on alluvium. Both rainfed and irrigated agriculture are practised in the region. Rice, maize, barley, pigeon pea, wheat, mustard, lentil, sugar cane and cotton are important crops. Fertilizer use is low in AEZs 10, 11 and 12 because the soils are susceptible to severe water erosion and experience partial waterlogging. Rainfed farming is practised and rice, millets, pigeon pea, green gram and black gram crops are grown. Flooding, imperfect drainage, salinity and sodicity in AEZ 13, and a severe climate, soil degradation, soil acidity and droughts in AEZ 14 are major constraints on increasing fertilizer consumption.

Humid-Perhumid Ecosystem
The humid-perhumid ecosystem comprising three regions (AEZs 15 – 17) consumed 1.01 million tonnes of fertilizer (N+P2O5+K2O) in 2003/04 and accounted for 6.01 percent of total fertilizer consumption. The ecosystem covers 11.92 million ha, representing 6.37 percent of the total GCA of the country. Per-hectare fertilizer consumption was 85.0 kg, ranging from 36.4 kg in AEZ 17 to 94.7 kg in AEZ 15. In terms of nutrients, N, P2O5 and K2O consumption wass 45.5, 22.0 and 17.6 kg/ha, respectively. There was a wide variation in nutrient consumption between the AEZs of the humid-perhumid ecosystem. N consumption varied from 26.8 to 49.5 kg/ha, P2O5 consumption from 6.3 to 24.8 kg/ha, and K2O consumption from 3.3 to 20.3 kg/ha. Fertilizer use and crop productivity are relatively high in AEZ 15 because there are rice-based cropping systems and the length of growing period is 210 days. Fertilizer use is very low in AEZ 17 owing to adverse climate conditions and Jhum (shifting) cultivation.

Coastal Ecosystem
The coastal ecosystem, comprising two regions (AEZs 18 and 19), consumed 1.34 million tonnes of fertilizer (N+P2O5+K2O) in 2003/04 and accounted for 8.0 percent of total fertilizer consumption. The ecosystem covers 11.82 million ha, representing 6.32 percent of the total GCA of the country. Per-hectare fertilizer consumption was 113.6 kg, ranging from 80.3 kg in AEZ 19 to 144.7 kg in AEZ 18. In terms of nutrients, N, P2O5 and K2O consumption was 63.7, 26.3 and 23.7 kg/ha, respectively. There was a wide variation in nutrient consumption among the AEZs of the coastal ecosystem. N consumption varied from 40.5 to 85.3 kg/ha, P2O5 consumption from 17.0 to 34.9 kg/ha, and K2O consumption from 22.7 to 24.5 kg/ha. Fertilizer use and crop productivity are relatively low in AEZ 19 owing to excessive leaching, waterlogging and steep slopes.

Island Ecosystem
The island ecosystem, comprising AEZ 20, consumed only 700 tonnes of fertilizer (N+P2O5+K2O) in 2003/04 over an area of 50 000 ha. Per-hectare fertilizer consumption was 14.3 kg. In terms of nutrients, N, P2O5 and K2O consumption was 6.7, 6.3 and 1.2 kg/ha, respectively. Fertilizer use and crop productivity are very low in AEZ 20 owing to severe soil erosion. The land use is dominated by plantation crops.

Fertilizer use by crop
Before the 1950s, fertilizer use was very low and was confined to plantation crops. The introduction of fertilizer-responsive HYVs and expansion in the irrigated area led to a sharp increase in fertilizer application on field crops. Per-hectare fertilizer consumption is higher in the case of crops with a larger proportion of irrigated area. About 40 percent of the agricultural area in India is irrigated, accounting for 68.5 percent of total fertilizer consumption (Table 13). Six crops (rice, wheat, cotton, sugar cane, rapeseed and mustard) are estimated to account for more than two-thirds of the total fertilizer consumption in the country. The fertilizer-use pattern for major crops is discussed below.

Rice-wheat system
Rice-wheat is the most important cropping system in terms of area, fertilizer use and crop productivity. It is practised in various environments and on different soil types and covers an estimated area of about 10 million ha on the IGP. Per-hectare fertilizer use under the rice-wheat cropping system in the IGP is estimated at 334 kg. It varies from 258 kg in the Lower Gangetic Plain (LGP) region to 444 kg in the Trans-Gangetic Plain (TGP) (Haryana) region (Table 14). In the IGP, farmers apply 117.3 kg/ha N, 35.2 kg/ha P2O5 and 11.8 kg/ha K2O on rice and 120.3 kg/ha N, 38.2 kg/ha P2O5 and 11.1 kg/ha K2O on wheat. The productivity of rice and wheat crops in the IGP is estimated to be 2.95 and 3.95 tonnes/ha, respectively. In the IGP, the productivity of rice-wheat cropping systems decreases from west to east.
